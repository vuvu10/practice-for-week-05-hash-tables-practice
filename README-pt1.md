# Hash Table Practice Part 1

In this four-part exercise, you will get started implementing a hash table
that handles collisions with linked list chaining.

## Setup

1. Clone the [starter] from github
2. Install all packages with `npm install`
3. Run specs with `npm test test/hash-table-pt1-spec.js`

## Part 1: Hash table constructor

Start by implementing the constructor for the hash table.

The hash table should count the key/value pairs stored in the table and
contain a data storage array filled with `null` values.

Read the specs in `test/hash-table-pt1-spec.js` for more details.
